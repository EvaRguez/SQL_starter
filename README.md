# üìä SQL and Python Integration Project

Welcome to the **SQL and Python Integration** project. This repository contains a set of exercises and projects showcasing the use of SQL in conjunction with Python for data analysis and manipulation. The project emphasizes the power of combining SQL queries with Python libraries to process and analyze data more efficiently.

## üìö Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the integration of MySQL and Python to solve data-related problems. It includes:

1. **Data Querying with SQL**: Demonstrates querying and manipulating data using SQL.
2. **Python Implementation**: Shows how to use Python to automate and visualize SQL outputs.

### üóÇÔ∏è Files in the Repository

- **`Pedidos_SQL.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing SQL queries for working with the `Pedidos` database.
- **`Pedidos_SQL_PY.ipynb`**: Notebook showcasing how to integrate SQL queries with Python to extract and manipulate data.
- **`pedidos.sql`**: The schema and data for the `Pedidos` database used in the exercises.

## üìå Introduction

SQL and Python are powerful tools for data analysis and manipulation. This project aims to showcase how these tools can be used together to efficiently query and analyze data from a relational database, providing insights and automating tasks.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following files:

- **`Pedidos_SQL.ipynb`**: Contains SQL queries to create, modify, and query data from the `Pedidos` database.
- **`Pedidos_SQL_PY.ipynb`**: Implements Python scripts that integrate SQL queries to automate data extraction and perform advanced manipulations.
- **`pedidos.sql`**: SQL script that defines the schema and populates the `Pedidos` database.

## üîç SQL Operations

### Key Concepts and Functions

- **Data Retrieval**: Using `SELECT` queries to extract relevant data from the database.
- **Data Manipulation**: Utilizing `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` to modify database records.
- **Join Operations**: Combining data from multiple tables using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN`.

## üêç Python Integration

The Python implementation notebook uses libraries such as `pandas` and `sqlalchemy` to:

- Connect to the MySQL database and execute queries.
- Load query results into DataFrames for further analysis.
- Start to visualize some data using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. (for more information on visualization you can go to [Data_salary](https://github.com/EvaRguez/Data_salary)).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebooks in this repository, you will need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- MySQL server
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `sqlalchemy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EvaRguez/SQL_starter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd SQL_starter
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python matplotlib seaborn
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the `Pedidos_SQL.ipynb` and `Pedidos_SQL_PY.ipynb` notebooks and run the cells sequentially.

## üí° How to Use this Repository

1. **SQL Operations**: Start with the `Pedidos_SQL.ipynb` notebook to learn and practice SQL queries.
2. **Python Integration**: Move on to the `Pedidos_SQL_PY.ipynb` notebook to see how Python can interact with a SQL database and automate data extraction and analysis.
3. Modify or expand the notebooks to integrate additional queries and Python-based analysis based on your project needs.
